    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade <strong>Vanilla ice cream</strong> is easy to make with just 4 ingredients: pure vanilla extract, milk, heavy whipping cream, and sugar. This American or Philadelphia-style ice cream makes for a brighter, more pronounced vanilla flavor.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream.</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small 
        ring of foam appears around the edge.
      </li>
      <li>TTransfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, 
        at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)
      </li>
      <li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 
        20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the 
        freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
